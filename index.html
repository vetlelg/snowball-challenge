      <h1>What is Cultivate Sahara?</h1>
      <p>As the world’s population continues to grow, the same can not 
        be said for agriculturally viable environments. To remedy this, 
        Cultivate Sahara is a proposal intended to increase the area at 
        our disposal for agriculture.  This is made possible by using a 
        technique called hydroponic planting, a method of growing plants 
        without soil, by using mineral nutrient solutions. </p>
