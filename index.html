        <h1>What is Cultivate Sahara?</h1>
        <p>As the world’s population continues to grow, the same can not be said for agriculturally 
          viable environments. To remedy this, Cultivate Sahara is a proposal intended to increase 
          the area at our disposal for agriculture.  This is made possible by using a technique 
          called hydroponic planting, a method of growing plants without soil, by using mineral 
          nutrient solutions. This will allow crops to flourish even in nutrient-poor soil. In
          addition we propose large-scale cactus farming as a supplement, as the cactus plant
          will thrive under the extreme conditions of the desert, and provides some essential
          nutrients.</p>

        <h1>Challenge</h1>
        <p>Land degradation is a major problem facing the world today. Pollution, extreme weather, 
           overgrazing, over-cultivation, urbanization, and deforestation all contribute to gradually 
           degrading the quality of soil.  This will affect our production of food, as well as the 
           nutritional quality of the food we can produce. Indirectly it will cause an increase in 
           respiratory illnesses from wind erosion, increase the risk of infectious diseases as large 
           populations will be forced to migrate, and release carbon dioxide stored in the soil into the 
           atmosphere. Every year the population as well as the pressure on farmland increases. Coupled
           with the loss of biodiversity and increasing occurence of natural disasters, scientists warn 
           that 24 billion tons of fertile soil is being lost per year. If this trend continues, 95 
           percent of the Earth's land areas could become degraded by 2050.

        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>The Saharan Desert is a massive expanse of land currently thought to be nonarable. Cultivate Sahara
           proposes to make use of this land through hydroponic agriculture and large-scale cactus farming.
           Despite what you may think when you hear "Hydroponic agriculture", this method of growing actually
           uses about a tenth of the water consumed in traditional farming.<sup><a href="sources.html">[2]</a></sup>
           This leaves the plants mainly wanting sunlight, calcium and nitrogen. Conveniently, calcium and nitrogen
           are found in the cactus plant, and sunlight is ofcourse plentiful in the Saharan desert.  
           Cacti are known for their extreme resilience to dry soil and offer a surprisingly high degree of 
           nutritional value, including some protein and fibre, and a high amount of vitamin A and calcium. </p>
